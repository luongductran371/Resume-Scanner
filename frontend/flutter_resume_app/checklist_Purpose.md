# Purpose of UI Tests

- **File selection works**: Ensures users can provide valid input (resume).
- **Upload flow works**: Confirms integration with backend `/upload` endpoint.
- **Loading and errors are visible**: Provides good UX and debuggability.
- **Result rendering is correct**: Verifies mapping between API response and UI.
- **Resilience**: Confirms the app handles errors and retries without restart.
